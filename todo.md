## Task Plan

- [ ] **Phase 1: Research and design the agentic application architecture**
  - [ ] Research LangChain/LangGraph patterns for multi-agent systems.
  - [ ] Design the architecture for log analysis and code fixing agents.
  - [ ] Plan the integration approach.

- [x] **Phase 2: Create the log analysis agent**
  - [x] Develop the first agent that reads SLF4J log files.
  - [x] Parse log files to extract exceptions, stack traces, and relevant error information.

- [x] **Phase 3: Create the code fixing agent**
  - [x] Develop the second agent that analyzes exceptions.
  - [x] Generate Java code fixes using LLM capabilities, with proper Spring Boot context understanding.

- [x] **Phase 4: Implement the multi-agent orchestration**
  - [x] Use LangGraph to orchestrate the two agents.
  - [x] Handle data flow between them.
  - [x] Implement proper error handling and validation.

- [x] **Phase 5: Create sample data and test the application**
  - [x] Generate sample Spring Boot log files with exceptions.
  - [x] Test the complete workflow.
  - [x] Validate the code fixing suggestions.

- [x] **Phase 6: Package and document the solution**
  - [x] Create comprehensive documentation.
  - [x] Provide setup instructions and usage examples for the agentic application.
